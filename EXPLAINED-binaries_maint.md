It is generally not recommended to upload the generated binary distribution files (.whl files) to GitHub. Here's why:

  - **Repository Size**: Binary distribution files can be relatively large, especially if you have multiple versions of your package. Including these large files in your GitHub repository can quickly increase its size, which may make cloning and fetching the repository slower for users.

  - **Version Control**: Binary files are not well-suited for version control systems like Git. Git is optimized for tracking changes to source code, text files, and small binary files. Large binary files can bloat your repository, impacting its performance and making it more challenging to manage and collaborate with others.

  - **Package Releases**: Instead of including binary distribution files in your GitHub repository, it is recommended to use a proper package distribution system like PyPI or other package repositories. These systems are designed to handle package distribution, versioning, and dependency management. Users can easily install your package using package managers like pip directly from the repository.

  - **Source Distribution**: While it is not necessary to include binary distribution files in your repository, it is good practice to include the source distribution (*.tar.gz) generated by python setup.py sdist. Including the source distribution allows users to build and install your package from source if needed. Source distributions are smaller and more suitable for version control systems.

Instead of uploading binary distributions to GitHub, you can provide instructions in your project's README or documentation on how to install your package using pip from PyPI or other package repositories. This way, users can easily install the latest version of your package and manage its dependencies using established package management tools.
