To package and distribute your utility as a Python package, you can follow these steps while ensuring best practices:

  1. **Project Structure**: Organize your project with a standard structure to make it easily distributable. Here's a recommended structure:

```adruino
    package-folder/
    ├── main_package_module/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── helper.py
    │   └── main.py
    ├── setup.py
    └── README.md
```

  2. **Versioning**: Define a version number for your package to track changes. In the custom_secrets_manager/__init__.py file, add a __version__ variable with the desired version number.

  3. **Dependency Management**: Specify the dependencies required for your package in the setup.py file. This allows users to automatically install the required dependencies. For example, if your package depends on anyconfig, you can include it as a requirement.

  4. **Package Metadata**: In setup.py, provide the necessary metadata about your package, such as name, author, description, license, and the packages to include. You can use the setuptools.setup() function to define this metadata.

  5. **Documentation**: Create a comprehensive README.md file that provides instructions on installation, usage, and any other relevant information.

  6. **Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of your package. You can use frameworks like pytest to write and run tests.

  7. **Build and Distribution**: To build your package, use the following command:
```bash
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

  8. **Publishing**: Publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) or a private package repository. You can use tools like twine to upload your package.

  9. **Installation**: Users can install your package using pip by running the following command:
```bash
    pip install custom_secrets_manager
```

  10. **Entry Point**: Modify the process_script.py file to include an entry point that can be executed as a command-line utility. You can use libraries like click or argparse to handle command-line arguments and options.

  11. **Packaging Guidelines**: Follow the Python Packaging Guidelines to ensure your package is compliant and adheres to best practices. This includes considerations like specifying supported Python versions, including license information, and avoiding hardcoded paths.

By following these steps, you can package and distribute your project as a Python package that can be easily installed.

Remember to test your package thoroughly, document its usage, and consider maintaining the project by tracking issues and adding new features or bug fixes as needed.
