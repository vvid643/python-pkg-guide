# setup.py template
Here's an example of a setup.py file with explanations for each section:

```python

from setuptools import setup, find_packages
from package_module import __version__

# Package metadata
NAME = 'package-name'
DESCRIPTION = 'A utility for doing stuff'
AUTHOR = 'Your Name'
LICENSE = 'MIT'
URL = 'https://github.com/yourusername/project'

# Package dependencies
REQUIRES = [
    'anyconfig',
    # other libraries
]

# Readme file content
with open('README.md', 'r') as f:
    LONG_DESCRIPTION = f.read()

# Setup configuration
setup(
    name=NAME,
    version=__version__,
    description=DESCRIPTION,
    long_description=LONG_DESCRIPTION,
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    author=AUTHOR,
    license=LICENSE,
    url=URL,
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=REQUIRES,
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable',
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
        'Programming Language :: Python',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9',
    ],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'custom_secrets_manager = path_to_main.module:main_function'
        ]
    },
)
```

Explanation of the setup.py sections:
  - **NAME**: The name of your package.
  - **DESCRIPTION**: A short description of your package.
  - **AUTHOR**: Your name or the author's name.
  - **LICENSE**: The license for your package (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
  - **URL**: The URL to your project repository or homepage.
  - **REQUIRES**: A list of dependencies required by your package.
  - **LONG_DESCRIPTION**: The content of your README.md file.
  - **packages=find_packages()**: Automatically finds the packages to include.
  - **install_requires=REQUIRES**: Specifies the package dependencies.
  - **classifiers**: A list of classifiers to categorize your package on PyPI.
  - **entry_points**: Defines the command-line entry point for your package.

In this example, the entry_points section defines a console script entry point. It maps this entry point to the main function in the main script of the package.

Once you have this setup.py file in your project directory, you can build your package using the following command:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This command will generate distribution files in the dist directory, which you can then publish to PyPI or distribute as needed.

## Entry point
The entry_points section in the setup.py file allows you to define command-line entry points for your package. Specifically, 'console_scripts' is a category of entry points that are intended to be executed from the command line.

In the following example:

```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'custom_secrets_manager = custom_secrets_manager.process_script:main'
    ]
}
```

Here's what it means:
  - 'console_scripts': This is the category of entry points for console scripts.
  - 'custom_secrets_manager': This is the name of the command you want to create. Users will invoke your utility by running this command on the command line.
  - custom_secrets_manager.process_script:main: This is the module and function that will be executed when the custom_secrets_manager command is run. It is in the format module_name:function_name. In this case, it specifies that the main() function in the process_script.py module of the custom_secrets_manager package should be executed.

By defining this entry_points configuration, when users install your package and it adds the custom_secrets_manager command to their system, they can simply run custom_secrets_manager from the command line. This will execute the main() function in the process_script.py module of your package, initiating the process of loading secrets and creating the registry as defined in your code.
