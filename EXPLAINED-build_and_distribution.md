# Build and Distribution:
  - **Building the package**: To create a distributable package, you need to build your package. This involves creating a distribution archive that contains all the necessary files for installation. The most common tool for building Python packages is setuptools. You can use the python setup.py sdist command to create a source distribution package (\*.tar.gz file) or python setup.py bdist_wheel to create a binary distribution package (\*.whl file).
  - **Distribution formats**: There are two primary distribution formats commonly used in Python packaging: source distribution (sdist) and binary distribution (bdist). A source distribution includes the source code and any necessary files, while a binary distribution includes pre-compiled bytecode, making it platform-specific and potentially more convenient for installation.
  - **Creating a distribution archive**: The `python setup.py sdist` command creates a source distribution archive, while python setup.py bdist_wheel creates a binary distribution archive. These commands bundle the package files, including the modules, setup.py, and any other required files, into a compressed archive.
  - **Versioning**: It's good practice to assign a version number to your package to track changes and updates. Versioning follows a standard format, such as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where MAJOR indicates significant updates, MINOR denotes new features, and PATCH represents bug fixes or minor changes.

# Publishing:
  - **Choose a package repository**: To make your package accessible to others, you need to publish it to a package repository. The most commonly used repository for Python packages is the Python Package Index (PyPI). PyPI is a public repository that allows developers to search, discover, and install Python packages.
  - **Package metadata**: Before publishing, ensure that your setup.py file contains accurate and up-to-date metadata, including the package name, version, author, description, license, and any other relevant information. This metadata helps users understand the purpose and usage of your package.
  - **Upload to PyPI**: To publish your package to PyPI, you can use a package management tool like twine. First, ensure you have a PyPI account. Then, run twine upload dist/* in your package's root directory. This command uploads your distribution archives (*.tar.gz or *.whl) to PyPI for others to download and install.

# Installation:
  - **Installation using pip**: Users can install your package using the pip package manager, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions. They can run pip install package_name to install your package directly from PyPI or specify the location of the distribution archive using pip install path/to/package_archive.
  - **Dependencies**: If your package has dependencies, specify them in your setup.py file using the install_requires argument. This ensures that the required dependencies are automatically installed along with your package.
  - **Virtual environments**: It is recommended to install packages within a virtual environment. Virtual environments provide isolated Python environments, allowing different projects to have their own dependencies and configurations. Users can create a virtual environment using tools like venv or conda and activate it before installing your package.

Following these steps allows you to build a distributable package, publish it to a package repository like PyPI, and make it available for installation using pip. Users can then install your package easily, either directly from PyPI or by specifying the distribution archive's path.

# Twine
Twine is a Python utility for publishing packages on package repositories, such as the Python Package Index (PyPI). It simplifies the process of uploading distribution archives (*.tar.gz or *.whl files) to the repository.

To use Twine to upload a package, follow these steps:

  1. **Install Twine**: If you don't have Twine installed, you can install it using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install twine
```

  2. **Build the package**: Before uploading, make sure you have built the distribution archive of your package. Use the python setup.py sdist command to create a source distribution (\*.tar.gz file) or python setup.py bdist_wheel to create a binary distribution (\*.whl file).

  3. **Ensure package metadata**: Verify that the setup.py file contains accurate and up-to-date metadata for your package, including the name, version, author, description, and other relevant information.

  4. **Upload the package**: Once you have the distribution archive and the required metadata, you can use Twine to upload the package to a package repository, such as PyPI. Run the following command:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

  This command tells Twine to upload all files within the dist directory. Adjust the path if your distribution archive is located elsewhere.

  5. **Provide PyPI credentials**: When prompted, enter your PyPI username and password or API token to authenticate the upload. If you don't have a PyPI account, you'll need to create one before proceeding.

  6. **Verify successful upload**: After the upload process completes, Twine will display output indicating whether the upload was successful or if any errors occurred. You can also visit the PyPI page for your package to verify that the distribution archive and associated metadata are listed.

It's important to note that uploading packages to PyPI and other package repositories requires proper permissions and authorization. Make sure you have the necessary access to publish packages before attempting to upload. Additionally, ensure that your package adheres to any guidelines or best practices specified by the package repository to ensure the quality and compatibility of your package.

# Install and run package
To run the package you published in your repository, you can follow these steps:

  1. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**: It's generally recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of your project. You can create a virtual environment using tools like venv or conda. For example, using venv, run the following command in your project directory:
  
```bash
  python -m venv myenv
```

  2. **Activate the virtual environment**: Activate the virtual environment to ensure that the package is installed and run within its isolated environment. The activation command varies based on your operating system. For example, on Windows, run:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

  3. **Install the package**: Install your package using pip. Since you published your package on PyPI, you can install it directly from there. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install custom_secrets_manager
```

  4. **Run the package**: After installation, you can run your package by executing the command associated with the entry point you defined in your setup.py file. In this case, you defined the entry point as custom_secrets_manager = custom_secrets_manager.starter_process:main. So, you can run the following command:

```bash
custom_secrets_manager
```

  5. Ensure that you are in the correct directory where your package is installed, and the virtual environment is activated. The package should run successfully, performing the desired operations as defined in your code.

Note: If your package has additional command-line arguments or options, you can pass them after the custom_secrets_manager command. For example:

```css
custom_secrets_manager --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
```
Make sure to consult the documentation or README of your package for any specific instructions or additional configuration required to run the package effectively.
